alpine Workspace
======================
This is an empty workspace. You can install anything you need to get started from scratch, regardless of the programming language you are using.

What can you do with this workspace?
------------------------------------
This workspace provides a clean environment where you can start building an application from scratch in any programming language. You have the freedom to install any packages, libraries, or tools you need.

# How to get started?
Here are some steps you can follow to get started:

1. Open a terminal by going to 'View' -> 'Terminal'.
2. Install any packages or tools you need. For example, if you're working with Python, you can use pip to install packages. If you're working with Node.js, you can use npm or yarn.
3. Start coding! You can create a new file by going to 'File' -> 'New File', and then save it with the appropriate extension for your programming language.

Happy coding! ðŸ™‚
